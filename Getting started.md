In order to get started with Qubic development, we must first understand some fundamental concepts.

# Wallet basics

Identity: 
	In the context of Qubic, an identity represents an entity which can hold funds, send and receive them.
Seed:
	The seed is a 55 character long string, which is used to create an Identity. It is used to calculate the private and public keys of an identity, which are used to sign transactions. This string needs to be kept private
Public ID:
	The public ID is the address of an Identity. It is used to identify the Identity.

# Tick
In the Qubic ecosystem, the tick is the interval within which the Quorum commes to an agreement on transactions and the outcome computed smart contracts. A single tick can last a very short interval of time (below 1 second).
# Epochs
A one-week time period from Wednesday 12 UTC to Wednesday 12 UTC during which 1 trillion QUs are generated.
